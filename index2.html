    <p id="text1" class="text-warning">Mars, Incorporated is a global food and confectionery company best known for its chocolate products, but its influence
    extends far beyond sweets. Founded in 1911, the company has grown into one of the largest privately owned businesses in
    the world, producing not only chocolate but also pet care products, gum, mints, and other food items. In addition to its
    popular chocolate brands like Snickers, M&Ms, Twix, and Mars bars, the company owns non-chocolate confectionery brands
    such as Skittles and Starburst. Mars has also expanded into the pet food industry with brands like Pedigree, Whiskas,
    and Royal Canin, making it a major player in pet nutrition. With a strong focus on sustainability and ethical sourcing,
    Mars has committed to reducing its environmental impact through eco-friendly packaging, sustainable cocoa farming, and
    reducing greenhouse gas emissions in its supply chain. The company continues to innovate by developing new flavors,
    healthier alternatives, and advanced production techniques while maintaining the high quality and consistency that has
    made its products so popular worldwide.</p>
